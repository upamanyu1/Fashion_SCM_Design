Zara – Fashion store
 They currently distribute their products from their own plants to their own branded stores or directly from fulfillment centers to home for online sales.
 They have decided to offer different delivery options for their online (e commerce & m-commerce) consumers: 
 Home delivery 
 Pick up in their stores 
 Pick up in a convenience store (e.g. an attended pick up point) 
 Pick up in an Automated Package Station (e.g. “un-attended” pick up point) 
The client Zara wants to design an omni-channel network
